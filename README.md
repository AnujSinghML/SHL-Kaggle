# SHL-Kaggle
This repository contains a detailed, well documented jupyter-notebook (.ipynb file) that I submitted in the Kaggle competition shl-intern-hiring-assessment , ranked 30th on the leader board. 

Please refer the notebook for details, it has comments everywhere required and markdown cells for documentation and clarity.
