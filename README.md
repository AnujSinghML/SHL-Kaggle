# SHL-Kaggle
This repository contains a detailed, well documented jupyter-notebook (.ipynb file) that I submitted in the Kaggle competition shl-intern-hiring-assessment , ranked 30th on the leader board. 

Please refer the notebook for details, it has comments everywhere required and markdown cells for documentation and clarity.

You can also find it on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/code/anujsinghml/anujsingh-shl

# Important Note
I have added the files after the step of transcribing_audio using Whisper. As that step takes high GPU power and more than 2 hours, I have saved it for direct use and testing of rest of the code.
