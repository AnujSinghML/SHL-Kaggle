# SHL-Kaggle
This repository contains a detailed, well documented jupyter-notebook (.ipynb file) that I submitted in the Kaggle competition shl-intern-hiring-assessment.

Please refer the notebook for details, it has comments everywhere required and markdown cells for documentation and clarity.

You can also find it on Kaggle : [https://www.kaggle.com/code/anujsinghml/anujsingh-shl](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anujsinghml/anujsingh-shl)

# Important Note
I have added the files after the step of transcribing_audio using Whisper. As that step takes high GPU power and more than 2 hours, I have saved it for direct use and testing of rest of the code.
